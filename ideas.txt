# Ideas

alt commands like \r should be /r  
comments should be // like C++ 
/ is better than \
* easier to test in ASM80
* frees up \ for ASCII commands like \n etc like C
/b should be /c (char)
/w should be /i or /n (integer or number)
/c should be /p for partial application
.a should print an array
map filter reduce
macros
backspace
editing
list
loop syntax
expressions for -- and ++
reset 
/z} should be :}
:} or :|} means repeat a section in musical notation 

### Notes: 

() are reserved for args and are never nested

} must be used to end the block because it is used with the nesting algorithm to 
find the end of the block. It can be combined with other chars but these are treated
differently while parsing commands
